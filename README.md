Be productive while Claude cooks:

When I am coding with AI there are long breaks into between me giving me commands to the AI. Typically I spend that time doom scrolling which distracts me and pu†s me in a bad mental state. I'd like to use that time now to chat with you and generate new ideas, and also reflect on my other ideas and businesses and content. I'm not sure how I'd like to use this chat or what role I'd like you to play, but I think ti could be much more useful than me doom scrolling. What do you think? What could be the best way for us to use this chat?
